## Course objective

Hello and welcome to the VS Code 101 course. The purpose of this course is to give a basic and solid introduction to Visual Studio Code. The course will start from scratch by installing it. After installing it we'll explore the editor and highlight why Visual Studio Code should not be seen as "another text editor". 

## Target audience

The target audience is everyone who is interested in using a more powerful editor than Notepad or Writer. The only pre-requisite is that you have some basic and Windows/Mac knowledge.

## Your instructor

My name is Tom Coudyzer, I'm currently working as a Technology and Innovation manager at Iptor. If you are wondering what I'm up to, ite means I'm following and looking for what's out there in the technology world. Asses those technologies and look if they would be a possible fit within Iptors' hardware en software landscape. I have always been keen on getting my hands dirty on new technologies. Often this leads to a lot of excitment, although I must admit sometimes you run into frustration. Besides the innovation manager I'm currently also looking into architecture which was a newly discovered world in het last world. This requires a different mindset which requires you to take a step backward and look things for a little further distance. 

Beside my passion for IT, I'm also very much enjoying cycling. This is no wonder, as I'm living in Belgium, which, you can say, is crazy about cycling. This goes both in the active and passive sense.

## Why this course?

This course was created because I love to teach. I learned as well this requires me to dig deep into the topics I teach. In this way I can pass my knowledge on through others and try to answer their questions. In the past I teached some courses which assumed some basic knowledge like JSON, HTML, CSS, JS, etc. It seemed that this basic knowledge was sometimes missing in the class group. In order to close that gap this is a first course in a series of teaching some basic knowledge in the "modern" world of HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, etc.
